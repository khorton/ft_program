 \subsubsection*{Procedure}
 \begin{compactenum}
    \item The Turn Coordinator is calibrated by adjusting the RIGHT and LEFT CAL trimpots.  DO NOT force the trimpots beyond the 9 o'clock or 3 o'clock position.
    \item Turning trimpots to right decreases number of TC bars lit for a given rate of turn.
    \item Disengage the wing leveler.
    \item Time a 360\textdegree turn with 6 bars of the TC showing (TC extended to the white triangle.)
    \item If time for 360\textdegree turn is not 3 minutes, then adjust the appropriate trimpot and try again.
    \end{compactenum}

 \subsubsection*{Notes}
 \begin{compactenum}
    \item Given 6 bar resolution, the test accuracy is 1/4\textdegree per second, or about 10 seconds for the complete turn.
    \item See AP--1 Manual, page 18 for more information.
    \end{compactenum}
