 \subsubsection*{Procedure}
 \begin{compactenum}
   \item Set both altimeters to 29.92.
   \item Find altitude with smooth air that will allow the target speed to be obtained in level flight.
   \item Conduct four runs at each speed, with the run headings separated by approximately 90\textdegree.
   \item Record "round-dial" airspeed and altitude, GPS track, ground speed and OAT for each run.
   \end{compactenum}
