 \subsubsection*{Procedure}
 \begin{compactenum}
    \item Gain is set by adjusting the SPAN trimpot.  DO NOT force the trimpot beyond the 9 o'clock or 3 o'clock position.
    \item Turning SPAN to left decreases gain, SPAN to right increases gain.
    \item Engage wing leveler in WL mode.
    \item Decrease gain until stick is smooth, then increase it until stick becomes jittery.
    \item Set gain as high as possible without jittery stick movement.
    \end{compactenum}

 \subsubsection*{Notes}
 \begin{compactenum}
    \item If final gain is greater than 75\% of full travel, then RANGE trimpot is set too high.
    \item If final gain is greater than 75\% of full travel, see AP--1 Manual, page 14 for procedure to adjust RANGE on ground.
    \end{compactenum}
