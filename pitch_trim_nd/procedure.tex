\subsubsection*{Procedure}
  \begin{compactenum}
    \item Determine maximum speed (up to $\mathrm{V_{NE}}$) to with full nose down pitch trim.
    \item If there is excess trim at $\mathrm{V_{NE}}$, set full nose down trim at $\mathrm{V_{NE}}$, then release the stick and assess aircraft response.
    \item Repeat with idle power.
    \item If the aircraft response at full nose down trim is excessive:
    \begin{compactenum}
      \item Set trim for $\mathrm{V_{NE}}$ (most nose down of all powers), and land without retrimming.  
      \item Adjust trim travel to minimize the excess.
      \item Repeat flight test.
      \end{compactenum}
