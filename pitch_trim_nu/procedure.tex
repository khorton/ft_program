\subsubsection*{Procedure}
  \begin{compactenum}
    \item Determine minimum speed with full nose up pitch trim.
    \item If there is excess trim at $\mathrm{1.3V_{S}}$, set full nose up trim at $\mathrm{1.3V_{S}}$, then release the stick and assess aircraft response.
    \item Repeat with idle power.
    \item Repeat with power for level flight.
    \item If the aircraft response at full up down trim is excessive:
    \begin{compactenum}
      \item Set trim for $\mathrm{1.3V_{S}}$ (most nose up of all powers), and land without retrimming.  
      \item Adjust trim travel to minimize the excess.
      \item Repeat flight test.
      \end{compactenum}
